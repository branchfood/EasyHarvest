Intro: GCG has installed over 400 raised-beds and worked with hundreds of home owners, businesses, schools, and restaurants in Eastern MA


Problem: She has institutional clients like Centerville elementary school, corporate clients like Whole Foods, and a variety of residential clients to manage across Boston. She has spreadsheets full of data but can’t stand to look at them, can’t glean useful information from them, and she has fixed-size automotive fleet - she can’t just add people and trucks. More people = more cost

Market Overview: Agriculture, until recently, was considered an exclusively rural activity. Today, up to 30% of agricultural production in the United States originates from within metropolitan areas, and up to 15% on a global scale (Smit et al., 1996).. U.S. Department of Agriculture reported a 76 percent increase in the number of farmers markets in the United States, up from 4,685 in 2008 to 8,286 in 2014). Sept. 29, 2014 – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced the award of over $52 million in support of the growing organic industry and local and regional food systems. 

Our Solution: create real-time value for Jesse by moving all her paperwork into 1 simple platform to track all her clients. With our app, Jesse can easily monitor all her farms and gardens and have quick high-level stats on each location, such as size, yield, and type. She can also get more detail on any given site for in-depth monitoring, based on the farmer’s logs about recent conditions.

Business Plan: We offer a data management service for urban farmers managing multiple locations. Give us your spreadsheets and we’ll make that information more accessible. Save time and energy. Our revenue will come from a monthly subscription based on the # locations and size of locations being managed, and also on any additional information that wants to be simplified.
